Balance of color and width are very important, especially when persuing a form of artistic expression. I wanted to use more muted, but still fun, colors to enhance the directives of the blog. Sure, the colors seem a bit boring, but they also make sure all of your attention is on the wackadoo thoughts being spewed onto a page. I had to make some adjustments - mainly because I did not have a very good memory of how to play with margin and size parameters in html and css. I am doing well, albeit, I should be doing better with time management, but that is all on me - thank you for your support in this class!
