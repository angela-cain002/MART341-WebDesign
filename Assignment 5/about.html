    <h1>Why I Chose These Website Ideas</h1>

    <h2>Website Idea 1</h2>
    <p>For this website idea, I'd like to create a blog site that strictly reviews various albums and live music events. I've seen examples of music review sites, and I think that many of them take themselves too seriously, focusing more on charts and technicalities rather than the fun of listening to music, and I'd like to stray away from that.</p>

    <h2>Website Idea 2</h2>
    <p>I have some higher-than-novice experience in creative coding with html and css, as well as educational and professional experience in python and data science, and I feel that it would be interesting to explore the idea of a professional portfolio to showcase my previous works.</p>

    <h2>Website Idea 3</h2>
    <p>Professionally, I am employed at a data aquisition and decisioning company, but we at the company still have a vast appreciation for art and culture within our community. This is what inspired me to have some sort of online photography gallery as my third website idea. </p>
