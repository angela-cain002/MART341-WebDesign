    1. I believe I am most proud of my ability to get my theming of the colors and the pages as a whole accurate to my dream colors. I really wanted a strawberry matcha theme / green cottagecore theme for the entire blog project, as this is mainly for fun and to simply play around. I was also really excited about having user input comments being available in my table!

How are things going for you right now, and is there anything specific I can do to support you or improve your experience?
