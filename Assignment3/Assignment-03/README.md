    <h2><i>I'd like to explore my creativity through blog creation. I am a reformed tumblr teen after all.</i></h2>
    <p>When I was younger, I created blogs on the sometimes reprehensible, and always entertaining social media site, "Tumblr". While I hate the web design of Tumblr, with a firey passion, I would still like to explore the creation of blogs and practicing web design with no educational or professional obligation. Just me and my silly little thoughts.</p>
