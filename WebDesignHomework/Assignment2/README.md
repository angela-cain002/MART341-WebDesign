## Assignment 2
*This is my assignment submission for* **MART-341**
I greatly enjoy web design and am excited to practice and learn new elements at a higher level. Provided below are details about my overall experience:
- I have taken several Creative Coding Classes at UM.
- I currently work at a data aquisitions company in Bozeman Montana in which I have to use aspects of web design to create documents to train other tech workers.
- I enjoy practicing with HTML and CSS to create fun and creative web pages, though most I have created thus far have no further purpose than being pretty.
