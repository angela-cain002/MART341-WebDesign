    <h1>Driver Picks the Music</h1>
    
    <p>If you play the same music for the different people who enter your car, 1. You most likely have terrible taste. 2. You most likely don't care about the music experience you take people on. Both are bad choices - here is what we'll cover to correct your mistakes.</p>
    
    <h2>List of Topics</h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Playlist Naming</li>
        <li>Read the Room</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Playlist Naming</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Playlist Naming</strong> is key to keeping your musical tastes separate and personally tailored to any guests in your vehicle, even if that guest is just yourself.</p>
    
    <p><em>You need to have a fun playlist name.</em> These names are a window into your mind, into the minds of others, and into the journey that is unadulterated car music time. As someone who drives nearly 3 hours a day, playlist names are key to helping me set the tone for the trips I take.</p>
    
    <blockquote>“Tell me what you listen to, and I’ll tell you who you are.” - Tiffanie DeBartolo</blockquote>
    
    <p>I go by the music identity of 'listens to a lil bit of everything', and you most likely personally know someone who's in a similar tribe. However, the 'lil bit of everything' really depends on the situation, and how the room is reading.</p>
    
    <p>Once you read the room <sub>shown below</sub>, you can accurately describe the playlist in a short, concise, and hopefully entertaining playlist name.</p>
    
    <p><sub>There better be no capitalizations in those playlist names, I swear to god.</sub></p>
    
    <p>For example, <abbr title="Good Playlist Naming">GPN</abbr>.</p>
    
    <p>Can look something like this... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3qBHXY1PSOLp6Yz0UeKBWS?si=iFE8hySYQdyaM_gStqdN4w" target="_blank">a very funny playlist</a> and accurately displays the vibe of "sometimes I do high comedy."</p>
    
    <h2>Reading The Room</h2>
    
    <p>Reading the room is so important to the integrity of whatever drive you are taking. Whether that be 5 minutes or 5 hours, making sure you have music that matches the energy in the car is <sub>so important!</sub></p>
    
    <p>Side note - <s>if you are one of those people that sits in silence for a drive just because it is 'only a few minutes', I'd leave this blog. It's not for you...</s></p>
    
    <p>I'm preaching to a probably very confused choir - we all know that playing something like Shakira's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/3ZFTkvIE7kyPt6Nu3PEa7V?si=cd8a4f24584c437c" target="_blank"> "Hips Don't Lie" </a> is not a good idea if you are just leaving the hospital with a grim diagnosis.</p>
