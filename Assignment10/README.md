1. How did the peer review go for the discussion? Was it easier to remember to post and reply with this format? Can I help out with anything specific?:

I liked this format a bit better! I was very busy this week, and my work schedule just flipped to graveyard shifts, so many of my issues this week were due to a lack of time, energy, and mental capacity to complete things. 

2. README List:
I decided to work on a brand new page, rather than a continuation of previous projects. I beieve this is still within the parameters of the assignment. The page I am working on is index.html

3. Required Techniques (Must Have):
I used a class selector for my navigation bar, and ID selectors for each portion of the body. 
4. Select at Least Three Additional Techniques:

In this project, there are also the techniques of differing font colors, opacity, and borders. I wanted to keep this as a bare-bones page, and I experimented with font colors and opacity to provide a more 'pastel' and 'light' feeling page.
