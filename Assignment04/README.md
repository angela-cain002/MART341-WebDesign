    <p><i>What is the DOM (Document Object Model), and how does it power your web pages? </i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree of objects. The each object on the tree corresponds to a different part of the web-document, such as structures, elements, and texts. The DOM allows various programs (in this case, HTML) to dynamically interact with web pages.</li>
    </ul> 
  <p><i>HTML, XML, XHTMLâ€”what sets them apart?</i></p>
    <ul>
        <li>HTML - HyperText Markup Language is focused on the structure and design of web pages and documents. </li>
        <li>XML - eXtensive Markup Language is focused more on data representation and organization. This differs from HTML in the sense that it does not hinge on user design, presentation, and interactivity, but more so around the representation of the data it holds.</li>
        <li>XHTML - A portmanteau of XML and HTML, XHTML is the merging of the XML purpose of data representation and organization, while also including the interativity and presentation of HTML.</li>
    </ul>
  <p><i>What are the four essential elements every HTML page needs?</i></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Every HTML document needs a "DOCTYPE" flag, which communicates the type of page to the browser it runs on. </li>
    <li>The next essential element is the root element of "HTML", which essentially wraps the entire page in an html tag. </li>
    <li>The third element is the "HEAD" tag, which contains the meta information, such as character sets, links to external stylesheets(CSS), and links to other script languages </li>
    <li>Finally, there is the "BODY" tag, which is the content of the web page. For example, for a blog site, the "BODY" tag may contain some CSS styling, images, and text.</li>
  </ul>
