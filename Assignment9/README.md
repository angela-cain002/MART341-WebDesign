How to Pick Your First Guitar!
1. Acoustic or Electric?
Acoustic: Great for singer-songwriters, folk, country, and unplugged play. No amp needed, but strings can be a bit tougher on fingers.

Electric / Bass: Easier to press strings, great for rock, blues, metal, and funk, but requires an amp.

2. Consider Your Budget
Guitars are crazy expensive in this economy. A good beginner guitar ranges from $150–$400. Stay in budget, but don't completely cheap out, or you’ll end up with an instrument that you're so annoyed with playing that you never play at all.

Bundle deals (guitar + amp + accessories) can save money for electric setups.

3. Check the Build Quality
Check the quality of the wood / metal of the guitar, it's even fret distribution, and body shape. 

Practice playing it as well, pick a few strings, play a chord, and see if it stays in tune. If it suddenly goes off tune, there may be something wrong with the quality of the wood. (Wood can Warp! )

4. Choose the Right Size
If you're smaller or buying for a kid, a smaller size guitar might be better.

Full-size guitars work for most teens and adults, but body shape like slim or small bodied can affect comfort levels. 

5. Try Before You Buy
The best way to see if a guitar is right for you is to get a feel of it. It's weight, sound, and comfortability are key to how often you'll play. 

6. Think About Your Genre
Rock/Metal: Look at Ibanez, Jackson, or Epiphone Les Pauls.

Blues/Jazz: Consider Fender Stratocasters/Telecasters or hollow-body guitars.

Singer-Songwriter/Folk: Yamaha FG series or Fender acoustics are great.

7. Don't Forget Accessories
For electric: Electic guitars and Bass guitars need amps, picks, and various chords and tuners.

For acoustic: Get a case, some extra string changes, picks, and maybe a guitar strap.
